# 💼 100B Jobs – Job Hiring App

A full-stack application built to help a startup founder shortlist top candidates from messy LinkedIn form data after raising a $100M seed round. The app processes real submissions, visualizes all applicants, and allows intuitive shortlisting of top hires based on key criteria.

## 🧠 Why These 5 Candidates Were Chosen

Each selected candidate was chosen based on a mix of:
- 🔍 Technical background (relevant skills & experience)

- 💡 Creativity and clarity in answers

The app allows filtering these individuals clearly and justifies choices during demo.
